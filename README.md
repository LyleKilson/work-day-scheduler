# Work Day Scheduler
Third-Party APIs Challenge

## Discription 
A simple planner/calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. When the user opens the application the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. As the user scrolls down the page they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user "clicks" on a time block they can enter an event and save it in local storage with the click of a button. Even after the page refreshes the saved events persist.
